    "1. **Initial Question**: Begin by asking a broad question to gather initial information. For example:\n",

    "2. **First Answer**: Depending on their response (yes or no), proceed accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exploring Categories**:\n",
    "   - If the answer was yes, ask specific questions about that category to explore further, such as:\n",
    "     - \"Does your favorite color come in shades of red and pink?\"\n",
    "     - \"What are the common shades associated with your favorite color?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Exploring Attributes**:\n",
    "   - After narrowing down to a subset of possibilities, ask more specific yes-or-no questions related to attributes within that category.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Adjusting Based on Answers**: Continue asking questions based on their answers until you can identify the object.\n",

    "6. **Final Guess**: Once all relevant questions are asked, make your final guess confidently.\n",
