    "## What is Doctor Know it All?\n",
    "**Doctor Know-It-All** is an improv game where a group of people act as one “all-knowing” doctor. Each person contributes one word at a time to answer a question from the audience, forcing the group to build sentences together. The fun comes from the awkward pauses, unexpected phrases, and collective silliness. Today we're exploring how different LLM's respond to one another in this game. I will be using: **Google Gemeni 2.5 Flash, Claude Sonnet 4.5, ChatGpt-5, and Deepseek-V3.2**\n",
