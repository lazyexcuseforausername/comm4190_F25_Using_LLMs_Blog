    "## Reflecting On The Product Task \n",
    "Creativity is often about breaking out of the obvious and finding fresh connections. Since LLMs are trained on such a wide variety of text, they are especially good at generating lots of different perspectives from a single concept. They don‚Äôt replace human imagination, but they can definitely aid in the \"brainstorming phase\". I wonder if it's possible for LLMs to cure \"writers block\" and help our imaginations start running wild when they won't seem to budge.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Tech Time Travel\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "Explore how everyday tech we take for granted today (like GPS, streaming, or online dating) looked in its early days and how it evolved. Bonus episodes could imagine the future versions of today‚Äôs emerging tools.\n",

    "4. Invisible Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "Highlight the algorithms that secretly shape daily choices: playlists, ride-sharing prices, grocery delivery, and more. Bring in experts to unpack how these black boxes affect our personal lives.\n",

    "5. Generations in Tech\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",

    "6. The Offline Diaries\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Interview people who tried disconnecting from a certain technology for a week (e.g., no smartphone, no social media, no online shopping). Share stories of struggles, surprises, and what they rediscovered offline.\n",

    "7. The Gadget Autopsy\n",

    "\n",
    "    \n",
