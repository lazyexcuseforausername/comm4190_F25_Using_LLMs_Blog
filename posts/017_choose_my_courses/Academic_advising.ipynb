    "Spring Semester is quickly approaching and like many of you I have been carefully crafting a course cart with Path@penn, penn course review, penn course plan, and the help of an academic advisor. This process can be very time consuming, frustrating, and even anxiety inducing for some individuals. As a result, I wanted to see if an LLM could help with this. Would it be able to navigate the intracacies of UPenn's course requirements? would it be able to correctly identify the differences between our schools (ex: wharton, the college, the school of nursing, etc)? Let's find out.\n",
