    "### The Viral Lyric Prank  \n",
    "\n",
    "The **viral lyric prank** is an internet trend where someone texts a friend, family member, or partner by sending lines from a popular song **one at a time**, making it look like part of a normal conversation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The recipient often becomes confused, amused, or even emotional as the lyrics unfold.  \n",
    "- The prank usually ends when the person realizes they are being \"lyric pranked,\" often after recognizing the song.  \n",
    "- It gained popularity on social media platforms like YouTube and TikTok, where people share screenshots or videos of their prank conversations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, it's a playful way of inserting **song lyrics into real-life chat exchanges** to get funny or surprising reactions. Today, we will be doing this prank on **Google Gemeni 2.5 flash**. However, I don't really know a lot of popular songs.. so we'll be asking **ChatGpt-5** what songs are best for this prank!\n"
