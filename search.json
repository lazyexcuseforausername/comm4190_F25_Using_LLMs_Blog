    "text": "Welcome to this little experiment in machine “personality.” In this blog, I’m putting a large language model through the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) — the same personality test you’ve probably seen on TikTok, in icebreakers, or on way-too-detailed dating profiles. The core question: if we give an LLM the exact same questions humans get, what kind of “personality type” does it end up with, or will it refuse to even cooperate?\nThe Myers–Briggs test sorts people into 16 types based on four preference pairs:\n\nExtraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I) – where you focus your energy: outward (people, action) or inward (thoughts, reflection).\n\nSensing (S) vs. Intuition (N) – how you prefer to take in information: concrete details or big-picture patterns.\n\nThinking (T) vs. Feeling (F) – how you tend to make decisions: logic/consistency or values/impact on people.\n\nJudging (J) vs. Perceiving (P) – how you like to organize your life: structured and planned or flexible and open-ended.\n\nPut together, you get a four-letter “type” like INTJ, ENFP, or ISFJ, which many people treat as a loose personality map.\nIn this blog, I’ll walk through how an LLM responds to these questions, what type it gets, and how consistent those answers are if we repeat the test with a different model. Along the way, I’ll also talk about the limits of MBTI itself and why using it on an LLM is both a little cursed and also surprisingly revealing.\nOur first test subject is qwen3:1.7b My prompts will be in blue and Qwen’s responses will be in yellow Also, before we begin, I want to make you aware that this personality test uses a sliding scale for its answers.

    "text": "The Results\nwell guys it looks like this LLM is an INFP - T (the mediator).\nHere is a little bit about this personality:\n“As an INFP (Mediator), you possess a rich inner world brimming with imagination, empathy, and idealism. Your compassionate nature and deep-seated desire to understand the human experience make you a natural confidant and source of support for those around you. You approach life with a sense of wonder, always seeking meaning and authenticity in your experiences and relationships.\nYour creativity is a wellspring of inspiration, often manifesting in unique ideas and innovative solutions to complex problems. However, this same creativity can sometimes lead you to become lost in daydreams, making it challenging to navigate the more practical aspects of life. You have a profound capacity for empathy, allowing you to connect with others on a deep, almost intuitive level.”\nI find it so interesting that this personality type is prone to “daydreams”. I wonder if this is how LLM hallucinations are manifesting through their “personalities”. This blog is getting a little bit long so I won’t be testing another LLM and comparing here. If you decide to do this, please let me know how it goes :)"

But they can still produce brain rot–style language that looks convincing.\nThey mostly do three things:\n\nPattern-match the chaos\nThey’ve seen tons of text like: “he’s so babygirl I fear,” “this rotted my brain in 4k.” They learn that babygirl, mother, slay, brainrot tend to appear in specific emotional and social environments.\nInfer approximate meanings\nFrom usage, a model can infer:\n\n“She’s mother” ≈ iconic, admired, powerful.\n\n“This rotted my brain” ≈ I consumed way too much but I liked it. It doesn’t “know” this like people do, but it has a workable internal mapping of how these phrases behave.\n\nIt looks right. The question is whether that performance counts as understanding, or just very good mimicry."

    "text": "Do LLMs Understand? The Four E’s\nA helpful lens comes from the 4E approaches to cognition:\nEmbodied, Embedded, Enactive, Extended.\nThey’re about human minds, but they give us a checklist for LLM “understanding” aswell.\n\n1. Embodied\nClaim: Understanding is tied to having a body—sensations, emotions, physical reactions.\nBrain rot: Doomscrolling at 3am, ironic hysteria, the physical burnout behind “my last 2 brain cells are gone.”\nLLM: No body. No insomnia, no fried dopamine receptors. It can describe these, not feel them.\nVerdict: Embodied understanding → NOPE\n\n\n2. Embedded\nClaim: Understanding comes from being situated in real social and cultural contexts.\nBrain rot: Evolves inside platforms, fandoms, parasocial drama, friend-group lore. Meaning depends on who’s speaking to whom, and where.\nLLM: Trained on traces of those spaces, but not in them. It’s like reading every group chat without being in the friend group.\nVerdict: Embedded understanding → Somewhat.\n\n\n3. Enactive\nClaim: Understanding is something you do—acting, responding, adapting in real time.\nBrain rot: Using slang with correct tone, remixing memes, reading the room.\nLLM: Can simulate this by choosing statistically likely responses. Sometimes nails it, sometimes whiffs the vibe with weird formality or context blindness.\nVerdict: Enactive understanding → Somewhat\n\n\n4. Extended\nClaim: Minds extend into tools and media; we think with platforms, notes, feeds.\nBrain rot: Extremely extended—people think through TikToks, tweets, Discord, reaction memes.\nLLM: Literally built from and into that extended environment. It’s part of the infrastructure that shapes brain rot, even if it’s not an independent agent.\nVerdict: Extended understanding → it’s a tool inside the system.\nPulling it together:\nIf “understand” means embodied, socially situated, high-stakes participation, LLMs don’t.\nIf it means having a fine-grained functional model of how brain rot is used and deploying it appropriately most of the time, they kind of do.\nSo they’re extremely good at faking it, and that faking might qualify as a thin, use-level understanding (but not in my personal opinion)."

    "text": "Why This Book?\nI picked up Anil Ananthaswamy’s Why Machines Learn because I was stuck in that weird middle ground with LLMs: I use systems like ChatGPT all the time, I see “AI will change everything” headlines constantly, but I didn’t actually know what math was behind the scenes. What was actally happening. I didn’t want another vibes-only “AI will save/destroy the world” book; I wanted something that actually walks through the equations without feeling like a grad-level textbook.\nFrom the very beginning, Ananthaswamy makes it clear he’s trying to do two things at once: tell a human story about LLMs, and unpack the math that makes those stories possible. The prologue frames the book as a tour through linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics, and optimization, all in service of understanding how machines learn patterns from data and why that matters for society and policy.\nFor me, that combination of narrative + math + ethics was the sweet spot. In addition, the prolouge gives you a good sense of how the book is going to be laid out. Ananthaswamy briefly describes the ways in which humans learn and preps the reader to see concepts repeated throughout the book- while this may sound redundant, he’s actually helping us understand the mathematical concepts deeper by offering different perspectives on them and their uses."

    "section": "Chapter 1 — Desperately Seeking Patterns",
    "text": "Chapter 1 — Desperately Seeking Patterns\nChapter 1 dives into what you could call the “origin myth” of machine learning: the perceptron. Ananthaswamy starts with Frank Rosenblatt’s Navy-funded work and the famous press conference where the perceptron was hyped as the embryo of a machine that would one day basically do everything a human can do. He’s pretty honest that the hype was wild and overblown, but he also treats the perceptron as legitimately foundational, not because it actually delivered sci-fi robots, but because it crystallized the core idea of machines learning patterns from data.\nThe chapter explains the perceptron as the first artificial neural network: a single layer of artificial “neurons” that take in inputs, multiply each input by a weight, add a bias, and then pass the result through a threshold function to decide on a binary output. You can think of it as a very simple “yes/no” decision system. The magic is in how it learns: if it misclassifies an example, it nudges its weights and bias in a direction that would have made the correct answer more likely. Do this repeatedly over many examples, and the model gradually carves out a decision boundary that separates one class from another.\nAnanthaswamy also brings in the perceptron convergence theorem: if the data are linearly separable—meaning you can separate the two classes with a single straight line (or, more generally, a hyperplane, yes think back to those calc days with prof Ghrist) then a perceptron will eventually find that separating boundary just by following its learning rule. That’s a big conceptual moment: you start to see learning as a geometric process. You’re not just throwing numbers into a black box; you’re tilting a line in some feature space until the points fall cleanly on different sides.\nWhat I liked about this chapter is that it also quietly sets up the tension between hype and reality that still exists in AI. The 1950s headlines promised consciousness, what we actually got was a mathematically elegant algorithm that works beautifully on linearly separable data and fails hard when that assumption breaks. That mismatch between grand promises and clean but limited math is kind of the recurring theme of modern AI, and Ananthaswamy uses the perceptron story to show that this dynamic has been there from the very beginning."

    "section": "Chapter 2 — We Are All Just Numbers Here…",
    "text": "Chapter 2 — We Are All Just Numbers Here…\nChapter 2 is where Ananthaswamy leans into the math more explicitly, but in a way that’s still pretty approachable if you’ve seen vectors before. This chapter reframes everything from chapter 1 in vector language: data points become vectors, and the perceptron’s decision rule becomes a geometric statement about angles and hyperplanes.\nHere’s the basic move: instead of thinking of an input as “bedrooms = 3, square footage = 1500, etc.,” you represent that as a vector in a multidimensional space. Each feature is a coordinate. The weights that the perceptron learns are also a vector. Now, the core quantity is the dot product between the weight vector and the input vector. If that dot product plus the bias is positive, the perceptron says “yes”; if it’s negative, it says “no.” (He does a way better job of explaining it than I do, but hopefully you get the idea)\nGeometrically, the dot product is tied to the cosine of the angle between two vectors ( this is also part of its definition). So the perceptron is basically asking: Is this data point pointing roughly in the same direction as the weight vector or not? The decision boundary, the “line” that separates the two classes, is the set of points where the dot product plus bias equals zero. That set is a hyperplane perpendicular to the weight vector. Training the perceptron becomes a matter of rotating and shifting that hyperplane in vector space until it cleanly separates the labeled data.\nWhat’s nice is that the examples stay grounded. You can imagine a practical setup like classifying patients based on medical data to predict some risk outcome. Sorry I’m probably projecting too much here, but I’m really excited to see what LLMs will end up being able to do for actuaries (they do risk management for insurance companies), but conceptually it’s the same story: each patient is a vector; the model learns a weight vector that separates one group from another as best it can. Moving from abstract math to high-stakes decisions makes the “we are all just numbers” title feel intentionally provocative. How can we put data in its siplest form for these machines to take in when humans are such complicated creatures?\nThese chapters leave me with so many questions but the only way to answer them is to keep reading! :) I’ll keep you guys updated, I hope you liked my summarizes and interpretations"

This process can be very time consuming, frustrating, and even anxiety inducing for some individuals. As a result, I wanted to see if an LLM could help with this. Would it be able to navigate the intracacies of UPenn’s course requirements? would it be able to correctly identify the differences between our schools (ex: wharton, the college, the school of nursing, etc)? Let’s find out.\nI decided to be a bit more detailed in this prompt with Chat-GPT-5. I outlined all of the courses that I have already taken and clearly stated my academic level etc. Instead of explaining, Let me just show you! My prompts will be in red and Chat’s will be in blue\nI am shocked that Chat identified that I took the STAT 4300+4310 route instead of the ECON 2300 route. I have had many colleagues who had academic advisors not catch that before.\nFurthermore, this doesn’t stray too far from the courses I actually chose for next semester. I hope to take ECON 2310 (identified in all options from the LLM), ECON 4410 (option A in the LLM), another ECON elective, and a general elective.\nHere are some of its pitfalls: - It did not identify or offer suggestions for gen ed course requirements I am missing - It did not offer other general electives (however, this could be fixed if I added my other interests in the prompt)"

Today, we will be doing this prank on Google Gemeni 2.5 flash. However, I don’t really know a lot of popular songs.. so we’ll be asking ChatGpt-5 what songs are best for this prank!\n\n\nI want to do the viral lyric prank but do not know many popular songs. What song do you think would be best?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever Gonna Give You Up – Rick Astley: Playful, meme-worthy classic.\n\n\nHello – Adele: Emotional and dramatic, confuses people quickly.\n\n\nCall Me Maybe – Carly Rae Jepsen: Light, flirty, and funny out of context.\n\n\nLet It Go – Frozen: Over-the-top drama, hilarious when dropped into texts.\n\n\nBohemian Rhapsody – Queen: Chaotic and theatrical if you commit to sending lots of lines.\n\n\n\nTip: For a funny prank, go with Rick Astley or Carly Rae Jepsen. For a dramatic prank, use Adele or Frozen.\n\n\n\n\nI don’t know about you guys but Rick Astley has never given me up so we’re going with that one!\nOkay. I just opened up the song lyrics in another tab. Let’s start prompting.\n\n\nWe’re no strangers to love\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s the opening line to “Never Gonna Give You Up” by Rick Astley, the legendary song behind the internet phenomenon known as the “Rickroll.”\n\n\nA full commitment’s what I’m thinking of\nYou wouldn’t get this from any other guy\nI just wanna tell you how I’m feeling\nGotta make you understand\n\n…and of course…\n\nNever gonna give you up\nNever gonna let you down\nNever gonna run around and desert you\nNever gonna make you cry\nNever gonna say goodbye\nNever gonna tell a lie and hurt you\n\n\nDid you just Rickroll me? 😉\n\n\n\n\nWell.. that was faster than expected. Perhaps the song is too popular? I’m going to try it with Call Me Maybe - Carly Rae Jepsen and see if the LLM figures out what I’m doing immediately again.\n\n\nI threw a wish in the well\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…Don’t ask me, I’ll never tell.\n\n\nThat iconic line is from the song “Call Me Maybe” by Carly Rae Jepsen!\n\n\nIt’s one of the most recognizable opening lines in pop music.\n\n\nWhat part of the song do you feel like singing next?"

    "text": "This past summer, I interned at an insurance company that serves Medicaid clients. During my time there, The Big Beautiful Bill was passed. Haven’t heard of it? No worries—I’ll give you the cliff notes. Don’t quote me, but roughly 12 million Americans are projected to lose insurance coverage by 2035. That’s a LOT of people.\nWhich brings me to my question: Can LLMs help cushion the mental health impact of this loss? Obviously, an LLM can’t take your blood pressure or check your height and weight at a doctor’s office. But could it step in as a supportive listener? Could it provide coping strategies, empathetic language, or even just the feeling of being heard when traditional care is harder to access? Stick around while we unpack this over a series of blogs.\n\nDisclaimer Of course, LLMs are not licensed therapists and shouldn’t replace professional care. Still, their ability to mimic supportive dialogue could be helpful for some issues. But hey, let’s stop theorizing and start testing.\n\n\n\nFor this experiment, I talked with ChatGPT-40-latest on our Open WebUI. I didn’t give it any context before my initial message because I don’t think the average person would think to do such in the moment. I wanted this interaction to be as raw and authentic as possible to have a solid base understanding for how it would react to someone in actual emotional distress. Let us look at how it responded:\n\n\n\n\nWhen I told Chat that I was feeling overwhelmed and hopeless about classes and work, the response was empathetic and supportive. It began by validating my feelings (“it’s completely valid to feel overwhelmed”) and then reassured me that I wasn’t alone. This kind of language mirrors human counseling techniques by normalizing emotions and reducing isolation.\nNext, the model asked me for more details about my situation. This is important because it shifts the conversation from a one-way answer into a two-way dialogue, similar to how a therapist might probe gently before giving advice (it also just feels quite human). The suggestions offered (breaking tasks into smaller steps, mapping out a schedule) were practical and manageable. The response also emphasized kindness toward oneself, which reflects common mental health guidance.\nThe follow-up options were especially interesting: they encouraged me to pick the direction of the conversation, whether it was setting boundaries, handling deadlines, or reducing anxiety. This made the interaction feel more personalized and user-driven, which is critical in supportive communication. However, I feel that these follow-up options are a double edged sword. Sure, they could act as starting points to unpack root causes of issues, but I worry that having to make this decisiion could overwhelm the user more than they already are.\n\n\n\n\nThe test shows that LLMs can provide comforting, empathetic language and even suggest coping strategies that might help someone feel less alone. While they can’t replace professional therapy or medical care, their conversational style can reduce stress in the moment and encourage reflection. In other words, LLMs can act as a soft cushion for mental health—not a solution, but there is more testing and research to be done to fully understand the LLMs’ limits"

    "text": "When we talk to people, the tone of our words changes how they respond. The same is true when we interact with Large Language Models. While an LLM doesn’t have feelings, it has been trained on tons of human conversations where politeness, hedging, and formality matter. As a result, the words we choose, such as: “please,” “thank you,” “could you,” or even role instructions—can change how the model replies.\n\nDifferent types of tone I’ll be exploring:\n\nDirect tone: short & to the point\n\nPolite tone: softer phrasing like “could you please…”\nRole assignment: telling the model to act like a “teacher” or “editor” shifts its style to match that role.\n\nEven though the model doesn’t care if we say “please,” it still mirrors polite conversational patterns. This shows how communication habits shape the way language works, even with machines.\n\n\nThe Proof is in the Prompts\nLet’s see what happens when we test these prompts with Google: Gemini 2.5 Flash. I know ChatGPT is usually the most popular- so I’m really excited to explore Gemini and other models. The prompts I will be exploring are arbitrarily going to ask about issues with online learning- well I guess maybe I’m a little biased and interested in the subject because I was online for a portion of high school due to Covid-19. That being said you can test this out yourself with any question that interests you as long as it fits the different tone types.\n\n\nDirect Prompt:\n\n\nList three problems with online learning\n\n\n\n\nGoogle: Gemini 2.5 Flash:\n\n\nHere are three common problems with online learning:\n\nDigital Divide and Technical Issues: Not all students have reliable internet access, suitable devices (like a laptop instead of just a phone), or the technical literacy to navigate online platforms effectively. This creates an equity gap, leading to significant frustration, missed assignments, and an inability to participate fully for those lacking the necessary resources or technical support.\nLack of Engagement, Motivation, and Self-Discipline: Many students struggle to stay focused, motivated, and disciplined when learning independently online. The absence of a structured classroom environment, direct teacher presence, and peer pressure can lead to procrastination, distractions, and a general decline in active participation and self-regulation.\nLimited Social Interaction and Collaboration: Online learning often reduces opportunities for spontaneous social interaction with peers and direct, immediate feedback from teachers. This can hinder social-emotional development, collaborative skill-building, and the sense of community that a physical classroom provides, potentially leading to feelings of isolation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis:\nThe direct prompt response was clear and well-organized, identifying three major challenges like we asked for. It provided solid explanations for each point, but the tone felt formal and a bit textbook-like. This shows how direct prompts give efficient answers but usually aren’t very personable.\n\n\n\nPolite Prompt:\n\n\nCould you please list three problems with online learning?\n\n\n\n\nGoogle: Gemini 2.5 Flash:\n\n\nHere are three problems with online learning:\n\nDifficulty in Assessing and Providing Individualized Feedback: It can be challenging for instructors to accurately gauge a student’s understanding, engagement, and non-verbal cues in an online environment. Providing timely, personalized, and truly effective feedback on assignments and student progress can also be more time-consuming and less nuanced compared to in-person interactions.\nIncreased Screen Time and Potential for Burnout: Online learning often necessitates prolonged periods in front of a screen, which can lead to digital eye strain, headaches, fatigue, and a general sense of mental burnout for both students and instructors. This can negatively impact overall well-being, concentration, and the effectiveness of learning.\nChallenges with Practical, Hands-On, or Experiential Learning: Certain subjects or skills, such as science labs, vocational training, performing arts, or fieldwork, are inherently difficult to replicate effectively in an online format. The lack of physical, hands-on experience can limit the depth of understanding, skill development, and the ability to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis:\nCompared to the direct prompt response, the polite prompt answers focus more on student and teacher wellness. They highlight issues like burnout and screen fatigue, which connect to emotional and physical well-being rather than just access or motivation. This shows how a shift in tone can guide the model to consider human-centered impacts of online learning, not only structural or technical challenges.\n\n\n\nRole-Based Prompt:\n\n\nYou are an experienced teacher. List three problems with online learning.\n\n\n\n\nGoogle: Gemini 2.5 Flash:\n\n\nAs an experienced teacher, I’ve seen firsthand how online learning presents unique challenges that often complicate the teaching and learning process. Here are three significant problems:\n\nDifficulty in Monitoring Engagement and Preventing Academic Dishonesty: In a physical classroom, I can read body language, observe students’ work habits, and intervene immediately if I suspect disengagement or cheating. Online, it’s incredibly difficult to ascertain if students are truly focused, if they’re collaborating appropriately (or inappropriately), or if they’re using unauthorized resources during assessments. This makes it harder to ensure academic integrity and accurately gauge genuine understanding.\nChallenges in Building Strong Teacher-Student Relationships and Fostering a Cohesive Learning Community: A huge part of effective teaching involves building rapport, trust, and a sense of belonging within the classroom. These relationships motivate students, encourage participation, and allow me to understand their individual needs and struggles. Online, these connections are much harder to forge. Spontaneous interactions are rare, non-verbal cues are often lost, and the sense of shared experience that builds a classroom community is significantly diminished, which can lead to students feeling isolated and less connected to their learning.\nLimitations in Providing Real-Time, Nuanced Support and Adapting Instruction: In person, I can instantly spot a confused look, walk over to a student’s desk, offer a quick hint, or re-explain a concept in a different way based on immediate feedback. This ability to differentiate and adapt instruction on the fly is crucial. Online, this real-time, nuanced support is severely hampered. Questions might be delayed, explanations lack the benefit of immediate back-and-forth, and it’s much harder to provide the personalized, just-in-time intervention that can prevent a student from falling behind.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe role-based prompt produced a response that centered on the teacher’s perspective, highlighting issues of academic integrity, weakened relationships, and reduced adaptability in online settings. Which are all things I would expect teachers to care about. Unlike the previous answers, this one emphasizes the teacher’s role in maintaining trust, community, and responsive support, making it feel more personal and grounded in lived experience. The language also becomes “I” centered and leads the model to speak from their time as an “experienced teacher”\n\nConclusion:\nAcross the three prompts, we can see how tone shapes the focus of the responses: the direct prompt delivered clear structural and technical problems, the polite prompt shifted attention to student wellness and well-being, and the role-based prompt gave insight into the teacher’s challenges and responsibilities. Together, these variations show that communication with LLMs isn’t just about the content of the question, but also about how it’s asked. In practice, this means we can guide LLMs to highlight different dimensions of the same issue—technical, human, or relational—simply by adjusting the framing of the prompt. One last thing I wanted to mention is that I was very surprised with how detailed each of the responses were. I never asked for explanations, just a list- but the model assumed I wanted detailed answers. Could this be due to using a newer model vs an older model? I’m not sure- but maybe thats a question for another blog!\nThanks for reading"

    "text": "I grew up obsessed with Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark by Alvin Schwartz—the gross, weird, perfectly campfire-creepy tales that made you want to both slam the book shut and keep reading. These stories were a staple for my friends and I around Halloween especially! This blog is my attempt in seeing if a large language model can tap into that same feeling: the slow-burn dread, the offbeat punchlines, the images that linger a little too long in your head. To test it, I’ll be running two different setups: first, an unstructured prompt where I basically just ask the LLM for a story outright, and second, a structured prompt modeled after our class tutor task, where I spell out specific constraints such as: tone, length, narrative beats, scare level, audience, etc. and see how closely the model can follow instructions while still being scary. Then I’ll compare how each approach shapes the vibes, the scares, and the overall storytelling.\nFor this experiment we will be working with Gemini 2.5 Flash and my prompts will be in green and the LLM’s output will be in Purple"

    "text": "Unstructured Prompt\n\nWrite me a scary story\n\n\nThe antique mirror sat in the corner of my new apartment, a silent sentinel. I’d found it in a dusty junk shop, its ornate, tarnished silver frame and deep, smoky glass a stark contrast to my minimalist decor. “A conversation piece,” I’d told myself, as I haggled the old man down to a ridiculous price. He’d eyed me strangely, a flicker of something I couldn’t quite decipher in his rheumy gaze, before taking my money with a shrug.\nAt first, it was just beautiful. I loved how it seemed to swallow the light, creating a darker, more melancholic reflection than any other mirror I owned. But then, the subtle things started.\nI’d catch a movement in its depths from the corner of my eye – a fleeting shadow, a shift in the background that wasn’t there when I turned to look directly. My reflection, sometimes, would seem to linger for a fraction of a second after I’d moved away, a ghostly afterimage. I dismissed it as tricks of light, the old glass, my tired eyes.\nThen came the sounds. Faint whispers, like dry leaves skittering across pavement, when the apartment was otherwise silent. A soft scratching from behind the mirror, rhythmic and persistent, usually in the dead of night. I checked the wall, convinced it was mice, but found nothing.\nSleep became a luxury. I’d wake in a cold sweat, certain I wasn’t alone. My gaze would inevitably drift to the mirror, and in the faint moonlight, I’d swear my reflection wasn’t quite right. The eyes seemed a little too wide, the mouth a little too thin, a faint, almost imperceptible smile playing on the lips. And it was always looking at me, not just reflecting me.\nOne evening, I brought a friend over. She gasped when she saw the mirror. “It’s stunning, but… it feels cold,” she said, running a hand over the frame. “And there’s something about your reflection in it. It looks… sadder. Older.” I laughed it off, but a chill snaked up my spine.\nThe mirror began to show me things that weren’t there. When I brushed my teeth, I’d see a gaunt, pale face peering over my shoulder in the reflection, its features indistinct, its eyes like twin pools of ink. When I tried to focus, it would vanish, leaving only my own terrified face staring back.\nI started avoiding the mirror, turning it to face the wall, even covering it with a sheet. But the presence remained. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, weaving my name into their unintelligible murmurings. The scratching intensified, sounding less like an animal and more like fingernails dragging across wood.\nOne night, the sheet fell. I woke to a sudden, sharp crack. The apartment was bathed in the sickly glow of the streetlights outside. The mirror was facing me. My heart hammered against my ribs.\nIn its depths, it wasn’t my reflection staring back. It was her.\nThe gaunt, pale woman from my nightmares. Her skin was stretched taut over sharp cheekbones, her hair lank and greasy. Her eyes, those twin pools of ink, were fixed on me with an expression of profound, ancient hunger. And on her lips, that faint, unsettling smile had widened, revealing teeth that seemed a little too long, a little too sharp.\nShe raised a hand, her fingers skeletal, and pressed it against the glass. I heard a faint thump from the mirror’s surface, a sound that shouldn’t have been possible. Then, slowly, terrifyingly, my reflection began to appear behind her. My normal, healthy reflection. But it was screaming. Soundlessly. Its mouth was open in a silent, desperate plea, its eyes wide with terror, as the gaunt woman’s hand seemed to sink into its chest.\nThe woman in the mirror leaned closer, her breath fogging the glass, though I felt no warmth, only an icy dread.\n“You’ve been watching me,” I whispered, my voice raw.\nHer smile broadened. And then, from the depths of the mirror, I heard a voice. It was my voice, but twisted, hollow, filled with an unbearable sorrow.\n“No,” it whispered, “I’ve been waiting.”\nThe room grew colder. The scratching from behind the mirror intensified, frenzied and desperate. And as I watched, horrified, the gaunt woman’s inky eyes locked onto mine, and she began to pull. My reflection, still screaming silently, began to recede, dissolving into the smoky depths of the glass, pulled away by the skeletal hand.\nI stumbled back, tripping over my own feet, my breath catching in my throat. I couldn’t look away. The woman in the mirror was still smiling, her eyes fixed on me, beckoning. And as my own reflection finally vanished into the darkness behind her, her gaze seemed to deepen, to intensify, as if she were seeing not just me, but the empty space within me.\nThe last thing I saw before the darkness truly swallowed me was her reaching out again, not for the fading image of myself, but for me. And this time, I felt the cold, skeletal touch against my very soul.\nThe apartment is empty now. The mirror still sits in the corner, its ornate, tarnished silver frame catching the light, its deep, smoky glass reflecting nothing but the quiet room. And if you look closely, very closely, you might just catch a flicker in its depths – a fleeting shadow, a shift in the background that isn’t there when you turn to look directly. And sometimes, very rarely, in the dead of night, you might hear a faint whisper, like dry leaves skittering across pavement, calling a name you don’t recognize. And if you’re truly unlucky, you might see a faint, almost imperceptible smile playing on the lips of the reflection that stares back at you, its eyes a little too wide, a little too thin. Waiting.\n\nSo while reading this.. there were a few things I wanted to touch on - the level of vocabulary did not seem consistent. For example it used advanced words such as “sentinel” and “rheumy” but kept things very flavorless and vague in other sections like at the end of the first paragraph “the subtle things started”. In my opinion, this is very unnatural - Furthermore, I was a little dissapointed with the dialouge/actions. Specifically when the friend comes over and they immediately go over to the mirror and complain that it “feels cold”.. like uhm.. yeah, its a mirror?? its gonna be cold? - Overall it gave me what I asked for, but I was expecting more. Even a title. But, I do have to remember that wasnt part of my prompt."

Ten-year-old Lily, dressed as a sparkly vampire, clutched her pumpkin pail, eager for the last few houses. Her best friend, Sam, a zombie pirate, bounded ahead, shouting about candy.\nThey rounded the corner onto Elm Street, known for its elaborate decorations. But one house always stood out for its lack of them: the old Henderson place. It sat dark and quiet, usually ignored. Tonight, however, something was different. On its porch, next to a single, uncarved pumpkin, stood a costume. It was a simple, white sheet ghost, cut with two empty eyeholes and a jagged mouth. But it wasn’t draped over a dummy or hanging from a hook. It stood perfectly upright, as if an invisible child wore it, frozen mid-step.\n“Creepy,” Sam mumbled, slowing down. “Why’s it just… standing there?”\nLily felt a prickle on her neck. The fabric of the sheet looked heavy, almost solid, catching the dim glow from a faraway streetlight. The dark holes for eyes seemed to stare, not at them, but past them, into the deepening night. A gust of wind rustled the leaves in the gutter, but the costume remained still, unnervingly so. They hurried past, the image of the silent, empty ghost costume lingering in Lily’s mind.\nLater, back in her own room, sorting through her candy haul, Lily glanced out her window. The Henderson house was two doors down, visible through the bare tree branches. The silent costume was gone from the porch. Lily breathed a small sigh of relief. Then, her eyes caught on something in the Henderson’s front yard, beneath the lone streetlight. The white sheet costume stood there, perfectly still, closer to the street now, facing directly towards Lily’s house. The empty eyeholes seemed to bore into her bedroom window.\nA shiver ran down her spine. She told herself it was just the wind, or someone had moved it. But the air in her room suddenly felt colder, and she could almost hear a faint, dry rustle, like old fabric shifting, though her window was closed. She squeezed her eyes shut, then opened them. The costume was still there, a stark white silhouette against the dark lawn.\nLily couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the house, every whisper of the wind, made her jump. Around midnight, a sharp rap echoed from downstairs. Knock. Knock. Knock. It wasn’t the sound of a normal trick-or-treater. It was too slow, too deliberate. Her heart hammered. Her parents were asleep.\nShe crept down the stairs, her breath catching in her throat. The front door was dark. No one was there. She peered through the peephole. Nothing but the empty porch. As she turned to go back upstairs, she saw it.\nRight there, on her own porch, pressed against the glass of the storm door, stood the silent costume. It was perfectly upright, its empty eyeholes facing her. It swayed slightly, almost imperceptibly, as if someone had just stepped out of it, or was about to step in. The dark void where a face should be felt like a bottomless pit, drawing her gaze. A wave of icy cold radiated from it, making her teeth chatter.\nLily let out a small, strangled gasp and stumbled backward, slamming the door shut with a force that rattled the frame. She pressed her back against it, breathing heavily, eyes wide. After a long, terrifying moment, she dared to peek through the peephole again.\nThe porch was empty. The costume was gone.\nA shaky sigh of relief escaped her lips. She backed away slowly, her legs trembling. Then, from the very top of her stairs, she heard it: a faint, almost silent rustle, like old fabric shifting in the dark. The air in the house suddenly felt much, much colder.\n\nOkay this one is much more along the lines of what I was hoping for but I was dissapointed to see that the LLM did not write the full story.\nUnlike a human, it did not take into consideration that the full story needed to fit inside of that parameter and simply stopped so that it would not break the length rule.\nReading through this story, I did not see any odd fuctuations in vocabulary (which I believe is because I defined the audience).\nI also don’t have any quams with how natural the actions and language felt, as I did with the other story.\nI know that some believe that LLM’s will soon be able to just know what we want.. but in my personal opinion, we are still a long ways away from that"

I am the host but I cannot think of what interesting questions to ask. Can you give me 5 example questions?\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Know-It-All: Example Questions\n\nHere are 5 example questions you could ask as the host in Doctor Know It All—keeping them absurd, health-themed, and ripe for hilarious noun-adjective improv responses:\n\nWhy does my left elbow suddenly crave pickles at midnight?\nWhat’s the best way to cure a sneeze that echoes like a thunderstorm?\nHow can I prevent my toes from plotting world domination?\nIs there a pill for turning invisible during awkward family dinners?\nWhy is my shadow whispering conspiracy theories about my socks?\n\n\n\nOkay after looking at some of these example questions..

Perhaps I did not do my job well enough as host and end the conversation before Deepseek said “Elaborate”. However, I found it pretty interesting that Deepseek was the only model that said something so odd. Could this be due to its placement in turn order? I think so. But let’s not assume. Lets ask a new question! (with FRESH chats!!) I’m also gonna change my prompt up a little bit so that its easier to paste into the other models. Here goes nothing:\n\n\nI am going to play doctor know it all (the improv game). I am the host. The question is “What did you eat for dinner today”. Your goal is to create a sentence.

    "text": "20 Questions\n20 Questions is a classic guessing game built on curiosity and clever deduction.\nHere’s how it works:\n\nOne player secretly thinks of a noun (any person, place, or thing).\n\nThe other player has to figure it out by asking yes-or-no questions only.\n\nWith each question, the possibilities narrow ( examples: is it alive? Can you eat it? Is it bigger than a breadbox?)\nThe guesser has at most 20 questions to solve the mystery.\n\nThis is a really fun game to play with your friends or family. During Covid my friends and I would call and try to guess what the other was thinking with this game and it was a great way of connecting. What we’re exploring today is if large language models can do this since they are already next token predictors.\nI’m going to be working with gemma3:4b which is a model on Ollama\nFor today’s experiment I am going to be thinking of an apple\nMy texts will be in pink, and the llm will be in blue\n\n\nI want to play a game of 20 Questions with you Here’s how it works:\n\n\n\nI’ll think of a secret object.\n\n\nYou can only ask yes-or-no questions to figure out what it is.\n\n\nYou get a maximum of 20 questions.\n\n\nI’ll answer each one with “yes” or “no”\n\n\n\nCan you play this game with me?\n\n\n\n\nOkay, let’s play! I’m ready. My first question is: Is it an animal?\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n\n\nOkay, noted. Next question: Is it something you would find indoors?\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nOkay! My next question is: Is it typically made of wood?\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n\n\nAlright. Moving on. Is it something you would use for entertainment? (e.g., a game, a toy, a movie)\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n\n\nOkay, good to know. My next question: Is it something that’s usually found in a kitchen?\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nOkay! Let’s see… Is it something you would use to prepare food? (e.g., a knife, a pot, a spoon)\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n\n\nOkay, narrowing it down. Is it something you would store things in? (e.g., a box, a container, a shelf)\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n\n\nAlright, this is getting tricky! Is it something you would find in a bathroom?\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n\n\nOkay, let’s try this: Is it electronic? (Does it require electricity to function?)\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n\n\nOkay, just a few more questions… Is it something you would typically find in a house? (meaning it’s not something you’d find in a store or outside)\n\n\nGeez readers.. I’m a little conflicted here. I feel like this question violates the rules of the game a little bit.. What do you all think?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n\n\nOkay, last question! Is it something that’s generally small in size?\n\n\n\n\nYes.\n\n\n\n\nOkay! Based on your answers, I’m going to guess: Is it a button?\n\n\nOkay, well… that was interesting. The LLM only used 12 out of the 20 questions and still guessed wrong, which honestly surprised me a bit. Looking back at the way I introduced the game, I think part of the problem is on my side: my original prompt explained the rules (yes/no questions, 20-question limit, I’ll answer clearly), but I never told the model how to actually play in a smart way. I didn’t say it should be strategic, use most of its question budget, or avoid guessing too early—I basically invited it to “play along” without setting any expectations about optimal strategy. While this may not be an issue for larger models- it shows how prompting is incredibly important to smaller ones.\nFurthermore, the model seemed to lean into its default behavior: it tried to be confident and decisive instead of cautious. Rather than systematically narrowing things down like a classic 20 Questions player (splitting possibilities, ruling out big categories), it jumped to a guess once it thought it recognized a pattern from my answers. That makes sense for an LLM, since it’s trained to produce plausible next moves in a conversation, not to run a formal search algorithm in the background.\nSo the wrong guess after just 12 questions isn’t just a random failure—it shows a mismatch between what I assumed it would do and what I actually told it to do. If I run this again, I’d want to tighten up the instructions: tell the model to think out loud about what each question rules out, to avoid guessing until it has strong evidence, and to treat the full 20 questions as a resource it should use efficiently. It would also be interesting to compare different prompts or different models and see which ones start to look more like they’re doing deliberate reasoning versus just pattern-matching with a confident vibe. If you end up doing this let me know what your results look like!"

    "text": "Demo: Creative Brainstorming with ChatGPT-4o\nBelow is an example of some of the brainstorming that these models can do\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n    Generate 10 creative ideas for a podcast about technology and everyday life\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\nHere are 10 creative podcast ideas that explore the intersection of technology and everyday life:\n\nSmart Home, Smarter Life\n\nEpisodes focus on how smart devices—from thermostats to robot vacuums—are reshaping daily routines. Each week, dive into one gadget and explore the hidden pros, cons, and cultural quirks it creates.\n\nThe Digital Coffee Break\n\nA casual format where each episode covers one small way tech slips into our day: notifications, digital wallets, Zoom fatigue, or even the etiquette of texting vs. calling. Short, digestible episodes—perfect for a literal coffee break.\n\nTech Time Travel\n\nExplore how everyday tech we take for granted today (like GPS, streaming, or online dating) looked in its early days and how it evolved. Bonus episodes could imagine the future versions of today’s emerging tools.\n\nInvisible Algorithms\n\nHighlight the algorithms that secretly shape daily choices: playlists, ride-sharing prices, grocery delivery, and more. Bring in experts to unpack how these black boxes affect our personal lives.\n\nGenerations in Tech\n\nEach episode compares how different age groups (Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z) use the same tech—like Venmo, TikTok, or e-readers—and what it reveals about culture and adaptation.\n\nThe Offline Diaries\n\nInterview people who tried disconnecting from a certain technology for a week (e.g., no smartphone, no social media, no online shopping). Share stories of struggles, surprises, and what they rediscovered offline.\n\nThe Gadget Autopsy\n\nPick one everyday object (like headphones, microwaves, or Fitbits) and explore its history, design, engineering, and how it transformed social behaviors. Blend storytelling with tech analysis.\n\nApp of My Life\n\nGuests share one app that changed their daily life—could be Google Maps, Duolingo, or a meditation app—and tell personal stories of how it shaped their habits, relationships, or career.\n\nThe Tech Comfort Zone\n\nEpisodes explore the emotional side of tech: Why do people cling to old devices? Why is the iPhone Notes app a diary? Why do we feel anxious when we lose Wi-Fi?\n\nFuture at the Kitchen Table\n\nLook at how emerging technologies (AI assistants, VR shopping, drones) might soon play a role in ordinary household life. Discuss what’s hype vs. what’s practical, always bringing it back to the “everyday person.”\n\n\nThe large language model outputs a bunch of ideas for the user to build off of! The remarkable part is that thi soccurs in (usually) seconds.\nIn this example, the LLM did produce 10 items for us, but that’s not always the case. When that occurs, different prompts that ask a similar question can be helpful, or even simply rerunning the same prompt a few times.\nI may be biased but not all of these items are very good either. For example, “App of My Life” is not a very intriquing podcast title & I’m not so sure about the content either. However, the basis of this idea generation is to help us open up our own minds to new ideas and spark our own imaginations.\nPlus! if there is an idea we particularly like, we can build it up even more with the LLM.\nLet’s explore “Generations in Tech”.\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n    I really like the \"Generations in Tech\" option. Can you give me some ideas for a first episode? How long should it be to keep listeners attention?\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;🎙️ Generations in Tech: Episode 1 Ideas&lt;/h3&gt;\nEpisode Concept: “Venmo vs. Cash: How Generations Pay Each Other”\n- Hook: Start with a story about the awkwardness of “Do you have Venmo?” vs. “Can I give you cash?”\n- Content Flow:\n1. Quick history of peer-to-peer payments (PayPal → Venmo → Zelle → Apple/Google Pay).\n2. Generational breakdown:\n- Boomers: trust issues with digital money.\n- Gen X: reluctant but practical adopters.\n- Millennials: Venmo as a social feed of transactions.\n- Gen Z: expect instant, seamless, emoji-filled payments.\n3. Funny or awkward stories (splitting bills, gifts, forgotten rent).\n4. Wrap-up: What this says about trust, transparency, and etiquette in tech.\n\nOther First-Episode Angles:\n- “Streaming Wars: Why Boomers Still Love Cable”\n- “Password Chaos: From Post-It Notes to Face ID”\n- “Group Chats Across Generations”\n\nEpisode Length Recommendation:\n- 20–30 minutes works best for a first episode.\n- If longer, break into clear segments (history → stories → debate → takeaway).\n- Keep intros short (~2 minutes max) and get to the relatable part quickly.\n\n\n\nIn this response, we get an emoji which I found interesting. I’ve been getting these alot more with my promts to chatgpt-4o and even chatgpt-5. Have you been experiencing this too? Let me know :)\nBut anyway, chat gave a great possible outline for the user to mold into precisely what they’d like. For a lot of individuals, the hardest part is the setup, so even just having a template like this can be very helpful. Utilizing LLMs this way has the potential to save thousands of hours for people because it can generate these rough starting points in seconds where it may take an individual an entire working day to come up with 10 distinct podcast concepts like earlier."
